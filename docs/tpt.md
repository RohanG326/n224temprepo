### Notes
- Computing has duality
- Some effects are beneficial
- Some effects are harmful
- One thing can have two different effects based on how it is used
- For example, wii controllers get people active while playing video games, but could cause damages
- Flowcharts before making a procedure can help find out beneficial and harmful effects of computing  
**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**   
Three beneficial effects of computing is simplicity. Computing makes people's lives easier and richer, with a vast amount of content and internet at everyone's fingertips. Applications are communicating and staying in touch with people from large distances away, online transactions and banking that is super convenient. 

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**
Dopamine issues are a huge problem. Dopamine receptors in more and more people nowadays are being overloaded with information, making the human condition worse. When people become used to having constant sources of dopamine, what happens when they are taken away is anxiety and depression. In developing teenagers, this can be especially harmful. Additionally to that, the same sources are incredibly distracting. Dopamine is addictive, because it feels good, and this causes many teenagers to get lost in social media or video games and stare at it endlessely, negatively impacting health and school in the real world.

### Notes
Digital Divide:
- Socioeconomic
- Geographic
- Demographic
- Age
- Religion
- Countries  
In some countries:
- Computers are not that common in rural areas
- Only a small number of websites
- The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
- There is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government  

**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**
In a digital world, one empowers themselves by using their voice. With social media on the rise and more opinions being shared, it provides a platform for information to get out. This can empower all types of people with different experiences to share their story and their voice, making the digital world more accessible for all. Before, leaders and empowered people had to physically give speeches and gain influence over time, in contrast to nowadays.
**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**  
We can increase their access to the internet. If empowerment is done by speaking on the internet, giving more and more people internet access and reducing the digital divide can help empower people that otherwise cannot use their voice. At Del Norte, I can help promote people to use their voice and advocate around the school, empowering groups of people to live more empowered lives.
**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**
Not much, nowadays. The internet stays fairly free of government entanglement, where people can relatively do what they want and say what they want under the first amendment. At Del Norte, it is slightly different, because we sign a social contract reducing our rights in exchange for a safe and better school environment. I think this is not a bad thing though, because the information that deserves to get out will still get out regardless.

Biases can be embedded all at levels of software development.
All software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):
Casual vs Sweaty
Youtube Kids
Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/Tiktok
WeChat / KakaoTalk
Questions to ask about bias:
Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
Intentionally harmful/hateful?
Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?
Google Home / Amazon Echo  
**GitHub Pages Actions. Break out into Study Groups of 2 or 3**
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- Although it was not intended, it is harmful, because introducing this bias is dangerous overall.
- Should it be corrected?
- It should be corrected, because otherwise, it is demonstrating that people of color don't have the same equality as white people.
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- To produce a better outcome, I would test by using different demographics to recognize all ethnicities and people to include them.

### Notes  
Crowdsourcing
- sourcing data from crowds of people
- easier way to obtain data without taking a large amount of time or too much error
- still has a larger margin of error than sourcing data individually
### Actions
**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**  
- A crowdsource project with cs students could be a huge mega repository, where everyone makes code and features on a forked repo, then all send merge requests to create one big ultimate project. Maybe as a post-ap exam fun mini project. I could send a slack message in announcements, and get it going with the teachers, so everyone can just make new files and push to the original branch.  
**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**  
- At Del Norte, for my own project, I could crowdsource by using surveys and gathering data about how our project looks, feels, and runs to make it better. We could crowdsource data in the form of feedback and apply it to our project.

## 5.5 Tech Talk Notes  
### Notes:  
There are multiple different types of licenses that you can have on your projects, that control who is allowed to use, and how they can use your work, and also control how you can use other people's work. The license something has also determines in what ways things are allowed to be used, such as for provate purposes or for commerical use, or if they are used, what percent of profits must go to the original creator. All of these things are important when determining what license to use.

When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
Licenses like Open Sourse MIT License allow people to use the code freely and distribute close source versions of the code. Another type of license, the open source GPL license lets people do pretty much the same thing as the open source MIT, but it doesnt allow disttibuting closed source versions.

Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
The license that we chose for our personal team project was the GPL-3.0 License. We picked this liecnese because it allows for commerical use and private use alike, as well as distribution.

## 5.6 Tech Talk Notes
### Notes:
It is very important to stay safe on the internet. This means protecting your information and your personal data. Some things you choose to put on the internet, like your name, email/contact info, college/eductation. Others are a gray area, like birthplace, adress, phone number. Others however, are things you absolutely should not share with anybody, like financials, passwords, social security number.

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
PII that I have seen in computer science principles is our names, our schools, interests, and possible contact information. This is mostly off our about pages, which were on last tris project.

What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
PII is a scary thought, as almost anybody on the internet can find out anything about you, but if you protect yourself and take the necesary steps to protect your information, it can be fine. PII can also be helpful, such as if you want to get in contact with somebody over the internet, say to work on a project.

Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
Good passwords use letters, capitals, symbols, numbers, and specical characters, while bad passwords are simple, easy to guess. Multifactor authentication is one way to create a more safe login, becuase it requires two forms of authentication before letting somebody access information/data.

Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Symmetric encryption is where only one secret key is used to both encrypt and decryot information/data, but in assymetric encrypton, it uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt information/data.

Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
I have been sent many emails from sketchy websites, and once when I was younger I clicked on a steam link that caused me to be hacked and my password taken.
