**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**   
Three beneficial effects of computing is simplicity. Computing makes people's lives easier and richer, with a vast amount of content and internet at everyone's fingertips. Applications are communicating and staying in touch with people from large distances away, online transactions and banking that is super convenient. 

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**
Dopamine issues are a huge problem. Dopamine receptors in more and more people nowadays are being overloaded with information, making the human condition worse. When people become used to having constant sources of dopamine, what happens when they are taken away is anxiety and depression. In developing teenagers, this can be especially harmful. Additionally to that, the same sources are incredibly distracting. Dopamine is addictive, because it feels good, and this causes many teenagers to get lost in social media or video games and stare at it endlessely, negatively impacting health and school in the real world.

**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**
In a digital world, one empowers themselves by using their voice. With social media on the rise and more opinions being shared, it provides a platform for information to get out. This can empower all types of people with different experiences to share their story and their voice, making the digital world more accessible for all. Before, leaders and empowered people had to physically give speeches and gain influence over time, in contrast to nowadays.
**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**  
We can increase their access to the internet. If empowerment is done by speaking on the internet, giving more and more people internet access and reducing the digital divide can help empower people that otherwise cannot use their voice. At Del Norte, I can help promote people to use their voice and advocate around the school, empowering groups of people to live more empowered lives.
**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**
Not much, nowadays. The internet stays fairly free of government entanglement, where people can relatively do what they want and say what they want under the first amendment. At Del Norte, it is slightly different, because we sign a social contract reducing our rights in exchange for a safe and better school environment. I think this is not a bad thing though, because the information that deserves to get out will still get out regardless.
